# Advancing Infant Distress Detection: Two- and Three-Way Classification in Real-World Audio Environments  

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview  

This repository contains the dataset used in our research paper:  
**"Advancing Infant Distress Detection: Two- and Three-Way Classification in Real-World Audio Environments"**  

The dataset is designed for training and evaluating machine learning models in detecting infant distress in **real-world audio environments**. It includes labeled **audio recordings** of different infant vocalizations, categorized into three primary classes:

- **Fuss** â€“ Mild distress sounds that may escalate into crying.
- **Cry** â€“ Intense distress signals indicating discomfort or strong emotional reactions.
- **Other (Non-Distress)** â€“ Background noise, cooing, or other sounds that do not indicate distress.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure  

The dataset consists of two main components:


- **`audio-data.zip`**: Contains raw `.wav` audio files recorded in natural environments.
- **`audio-labels.zip`**: Contains label folders corresponding to the audio files, mapping them to one of the three classes.

Each audio file in `audio-data.zip` has a corresponding label file in `audio-labels.zip`, ensuring a structured dataset.
